Description:

As you might notice, when we browse the Web with a Web browser, we usually use the domain name to reach a website. Does that mean the Internet and the Web are the same thing? It's not that simple. As we saw, the Internet is a technical infrastructure which allows billions of computers to be connected all together. Among those computers, some computers (called _Web servers_) can send messages intelligible to web browsers. The _Internet_ is an infrastructure, whereas the _Web_ is a service built on top of the infrastructure. It is worth noting there are several other services built on top of the Internet, such as email and [IRC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IRC).
