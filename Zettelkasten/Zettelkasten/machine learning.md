Description:

**Machine learning** (**ML**) is the study of computer [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-1) It is seen as a part of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence"). Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as [training data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_data "Training data"), in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-2) Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, [email filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_filtering "Email filtering"), [speech recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition "Speech recognition"), and [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision "Computer vision"), where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning#cite_note-tvt-3)
