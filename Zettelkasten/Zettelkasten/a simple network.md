Description:

When two computers need to communicate with each other, you have to link them,either physically (usually with an [[Ethernet cable]] or optical fiber cables) or wirelessly (for example with [WiFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiFi) or [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) systems or sending a signal to a satellite and sending the same signal from the satellite to a destination object which is not a good idea because the distance may be 22000 miles from the earth to satellite, so the receiving of the signal would be largely delayed). All modern computers can sustain any of those connections.
