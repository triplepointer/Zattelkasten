Description:

When two computers need to communicate with each other, you have to link them,either physically (usually with an [Ethernet cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_crossover_cable)) or wirelessly (for example with [WiFi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiFi) or [Bluetooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth) systems). All modern computers can sustain any of those connections.
