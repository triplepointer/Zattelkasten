Description:

If you want to send a message to a computer, you have to specify which one. Thus any computer linked to a network has a unique address that identifies it, called an "IP address" (where IP stands for _Internet Protocol_). It's an address made of a series of four numbers separated by dots, for example: `192.168.2.10`.
