Name: domain name
Status: #idea
Tags: [[IP address]]

Description:

That's perfectly fine for computers, but we human beings have a hard time remembering that sort of address. To make things easier, we can alias an IP address with a human readable name called a _domain name_. For example (at the time of writing; IP addresses can change) `google.com` is the domain name used on top of the IP address `142.250.190.78`. So using the domain name is the easiest way for us to reach a computer over the Internet.
